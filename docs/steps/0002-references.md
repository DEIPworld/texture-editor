# References

## Open Questions

- Should we display ??? after creating a new xref? Are there better ways?
- Should it be possible to insert a reference right from the text? (in addition to first adding it to the reference list)
- Add a tooltip that explains the ? symbol in uncited references?
- Should we provide an edit button for each reference in the manuscript? This could be useful when there's a long reference list, so you have to look for the record you want to edit twice
  - Possible alternative, addition: Access bibliography editor from toolbar
- Should there be support for custom in-text referencing? E.g. will I be able to write (Alperin, 2017; p. 22), as Alperinâ€™s (2017) research shows?


### Iteration I - Basic reference editing (Done)

Goal: Allow maintaining a bibliography

### Iteration II - Improvements

Goal: Provide an improved editing experience. Allow pre-populated fields pulled from Crossref. See Entities spec.
